# Procedural-Level-Generation

This project showcases a **unique gameplay mechanism** centered around **Procedural Level Generation**, where levels are dynamically created at runtime. This approach not only ensures endless replayability but also significantly enhances **memory efficiency**, making it a scalable solution for games of varying complexity.

Features
--------

-   **Procedural Level Generation**:

    -   Levels are generated dynamically at runtime, ensuring no two playthroughs are identical.
    -   Balanced design rules maintain fair and engaging gameplay.
-   **Dynamic Gameplay**:

    -   Adapt to ever-changing environments and challenges with every new level.
-   **Memory Efficiency**:

    -   By generating levels on the fly instead of preloading or storing large maps, the game reduces memory usage significantly.
    -   Optimized for systems with limited resources, ensuring smoother performance and scalability for larger games.

Importance of Procedural Level Generation for Memory Efficiency
---------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Reduced Asset Storage**:\
    Procedural generation eliminates the need to store multiple pre-designed levels, saving storage space on both development and user devices.

-   **Dynamic Asset Loading**:\
    Levels are created at runtime, reducing the memory footprint since only the assets necessary for the current level are loaded into memory.

-   **Scalability**:\
    This method allows for infinite levels without increasing memory usage, making it ideal for games with extensive playtime or large open worlds.

-   **Improved Performance**:\
    Systems with limited resources (e.g., mobile devices) benefit from procedural generation as it minimizes the strain on memory and ensures smoother gameplay.
